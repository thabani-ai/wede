1. Organisation Overview
GreenSteps Foundation is an environmental non-governmental organization based in Cape Town, South Africa. The organisation was established to address environmental degradation and climate change at the community level, starting with local clean-up campaigns and tree planting initiatives. Over the years, GreenSteps has grown to include educational programs in schools, recycling drives, and broader community engagement initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable living.
The foundation operates with a clear mission: to foster environmental stewardship through education, community engagement, and sustainable initiatives. Its vision is a South Africa where communities live in harmony with nature, contributing to a cleaner, greener, and healthier environment. GreenSteps Foundation serves a wide target audience, including local communities, environmental enthusiasts, students, schools, volunteers, donors, and potential partner organizations. By focusing on grassroots action and education, GreenSteps empowers individuals to make meaningful contributions toward environmental conservation.

2. Website Goals and Objectives
The GreenSteps Foundation website will serve as the organization’s primary digital hub, enabling it to reach a larger audience and streamline its operations. The website is designed to increase public awareness of GreenSteps’ mission and ongoing projects, engage volunteers, and facilitate online donations. A secondary goal is to provide educational resources on sustainability practices, such as recycling, energy conservation, and water preservation.
To measure the effectiveness of the website, several key performance indicators (KPIs) will be used. These include the number of monthly website visitors, volunteer registrations completed online, donations collected through the site, engagement with educational resources, and readership of blog posts and success stories. These metrics will help ensure that the website is not only functional but also impactful in achieving the foundation’s objectives.

3. Current Website Analysis
Currently, GreenSteps Foundation does not have an existing online platform, which limits its outreach, visibility, and ability to efficiently manage volunteer and donor interactions. This absence of a digital presence reduces opportunities to attract international donors, scale its projects, and provide educational content to communities in need. The proposed website will address these weaknesses by centralizing information about GreenSteps’ initiatives, enabling online participation, and creating a trustworthy platform for donors.

4. Proposed Website Features and Functionality
The proposed website will include a comprehensive range of features to meet the foundation’s goals. The homepage will feature a hero banner highlighting key campaigns and events, as well as quick access to calls-to-action such as volunteering or donating. The “About Us” section will provide visitors with a detailed overview of GreenSteps Foundation, including its history, mission, vision, and team members.
A dedicated “Projects and Campaigns” section will allow users to explore past and ongoing initiatives, with images, descriptions, and progress updates. Volunteers will have access to an online registration system, which will include sign-up forms for events, automated email reminders, and the ability to manage their profiles. The donation portal will offer flexible giving options, including one-time, recurring, and campaign-specific donations, all securely processed through a reliable payment gateway.
The website will also host an educational section featuring downloadable guides, videos, and infographics on environmental conservation, energy efficiency, and waste management. To increase engagement, a blog and success stories page will highlight achievements, share volunteer experiences, and provide actionable environmental tips. An interactive map will visually display the locations of all projects across South Africa, allowing users to track progress and impact. Finally, the contact page will provide a contact form, an FAQ section, and a newsletter subscription option for ongoing engagement.

5. Design and User Experience
The overall design of the website will be simple and functional, focusing on clarity, ease of use, and accessibility. Since the website is plain, it will not rely on advanced color schemes or heavy graphics, but instead on straightforward layouts that allow users to access information quickly.
Typography will be chosen to create a clear hierarchy, using bold headings to separate sections and plain, readable text for body content. The layout will follow a structured, minimal approach, ensuring that users can easily locate navigation menus, calls to action, and essential resources.
User experience will be central to the website design. The site will be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets. Navigation will be intuitive, allowing users to access volunteer opportunities, donation options, and educational resources quickly and efficiently. Accessibility standards, including WCAG compliance, will be maintained to ensure inclusivity. Low-fidelity wireframes will be developed to visualize the layout and information hierarchy of the site, illustrating how the homepage, project pages, volunteer registration, and donation sections will be structured.

6. Technical Requirements
The website will require secure hosting through a reliable South African provider and a domain name, such as greensteps.org.za. The development will be built using standard web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the potential use of frameworks such as React for interactive components. A database will securely store volunteer and donor information, and SSL encryption will be implemented to ensure safe transactions. Payment gateway integration will allow donors to contribute safely through the platform.

7. Timeline and Milestones
The project timeline is designed to ensure a structured and timely development process. The planning phase will take approximately one week, during which the project scope, goals, and sitemap will be finalized. The design phase, lasting two weeks, will involve creating wireframes, mockups, and design approvals. Development will occur over four weeks, during which all features, databases, and interactive elements will be implemented. Testing and quality assurance will follow for one week to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and security. The website launch is scheduled for a single day, followed by two weeks of post-launch support to address any issues and optimize performance.

8. Budget
The estimated budget for the website development and maintenance is as follows: Domain registration is projected at ZAR 500, hosting for one year at ZAR 2,000, and design and development costs are estimated at ZAR 15,000. Security and payment integration are expected to cost ZAR 3,000, while ongoing maintenance for the first year is projected at ZAR 5,000. The total estimated budget for the project is ZAR 25,500, reflecting a realistic allocation based on research and current market rates.
